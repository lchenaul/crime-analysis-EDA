Chicago Crime Analysis (2001–2024)

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on 23 years of Chicago crime data, focusing on patterns in crime types, locations, arrests, and long-term trends. The analysis explores:

The most common crime types

Hotspot locations across Chicago

Year-over-year crime trends

Arrest patterns

Predictive indicators for future crime behavior

The project includes both a cleaned analysis notebook and a formal written EDA report, accessible through GitHub Pages.
